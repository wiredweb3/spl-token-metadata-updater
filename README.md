# SPL token metadata updater
This script allow to modify metadata of your SPL token.
With some simple configurations you will be able to give a name to your SPl token and attach an image that will show in Phantom and other Solana wallet.

# How to use it

The repo contains the script and a token_metadata.json file.
The JSON is self-explanatory, just fill fields with your token data, then upload the file on IPFS, Shadow Drive or similar permanent hosting services.
In the script, just compile commented fields with all data of your keypair and token.

**CREDITS:**
The script was created thanks to a great YT [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQbt0-riooo) by https://github.com/loopcreativeandy.
I've just modified and commented some fields of the script in order to make it easy to use for me.
In order to understand how the script works and how to run it, just watch and follow his tutoriaI.
